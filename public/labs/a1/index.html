        <p>
        This is the first paragraph. The paragraph tag is used to format vertical gaps between long pieces of text like this one.
        </p>
        <p>
        This is the second paragraph. Even though we added a deliberate gap between the paragraph above and this paragraph, by default browsers render them as one contiguous piece of text as shown here on the right.
        </p>
        <p>
        This is the third paragraph. Wrap each paragraph with the paragraph tag to tell browsers to render the gaps.
